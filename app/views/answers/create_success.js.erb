// we want to add an `answer` partil and prepend it to the list of partials that
// are rendered inside the div with id `answers`

$('#answers').prepend("<%= j render 'answer', ans: @answer %>");

<%# If we want to render the `form` partial, then we will have to re-instantiate
    the `@answer` object because in the create action of the answers controller
    `@answer` is now a persisted Answer object which makes the form submit to
    the update action instead of the create action %>
<% @answer = Answer.new %>
$('#answer-form').html('<%= j render 'form' %>');
